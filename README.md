#Longform template
### A cookbook to make longform journalism look as good as possible online. Made for those learning responsive webdesign and developers looking for a streamlined toolkit.

This template is for people of all skill levels not looking to start from scratch on their new website. Tweaks and changes are encouraged as it is only a boilerplate for you to build on. 

This is the second version of the template, so bugs might pop up. The only way to fix them is to know about them, so please contact me at jabenedi@indiana.edu or use this [goolge form](https://goo.gl/forms/ZyCtO9zSwpZdcAiu2).

###Getting Started
[This page](http://www.jamesbenedict.info/template) contains examples of all the components as well as where to find their styles. 

Included in this repository is a project folder to start with. I suggest keeping the example folder unchanged for reference and starting in the new project folder. 

I like to use [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with the [emmet](http://emmet.io/) plugin for my text editor. There are nifty shortcuts that will make developing less frustrating. This [tutorial](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-complete-visual-guide-to-sublime-text-3-getting-started-and-keyboard-shortcuts) should get you up and running. 

I'm also a fan of using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to write quicker css. If you're starting out stick with vanilla css. You need a preprocessor to use sass, my favorite of which is [gulp](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/).

###Best practices
The first thing judged of any website is how it loads. Don't under look your primary feature. Keep in mind most online journalism is read on distracting iphones and people will leave if your site lags.

Optimize your images, concatenate your js and css files, and remove all unused files. 

There will be additional criteria for your website's structure depending on where you publish. It is best to get a sense for them early instead of accommodating them late on deadline.
